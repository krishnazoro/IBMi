# IBM i

## Definition

1. IBM i is an operating system made by IBM for its Power Systems servers.

2. It has built in database called DB2 so it can act like backend for running business applications

2. It’s mainly used by large businesses for secure, stable, and high-performance business applications.

3. It is used for 

- Banking

- Manufacturing

- Retail

- Insurance

4. IBM i is an operating system that supports programming languages like RPGLE, CL, COBOL, SQL, and Python.

5. It is fast and secure trusted by HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Axis, Toyota, Big bazzar, FedEx.

##  Pattern of the command

1. In IBM i the command is easy to understand  

2. IBM i Command has comination that is 3+3+1 like example i need to display message you can write the code `DSPMSG`, `DSP` is 3 and `MSG` is another 3 but 1 is option this is a method.

3. If you forget any command you write first letter of the command and put asterisk(*) `D*`, it will display what are the commands available. 

## License

1. Without a license we can't access any file or folder in this even can' program.

2. Code for license what are we can access.

```
GO LICPGM 
```
3. `LICPGM` means license program this code is for we can see what are the license we have.

## Work with active jobs

1. It shows you a list of all active jobs like programs, users, or system processes currently running on the IBM i system.

2. You can also end, hold, or release jobs from this screen.

3. You can see which jobs are active, how much CPU they’re using, and their current status.

4. The code for work with active jobs.

```
WRKACT JOB
```

## Work with system status

1. This command is used to view the current status and performance of your IBM i system like how much memory, CPU, and storage is being used right now. 

2. It is like the task manager in the window.

3. Code for the system status.

```
WRKSYS STS
```

# TN525j

## Definition

1. TN5250j is a Java-based 5250 terminal emulator.

2. That allows a computer to connect to an IBM i (AS/400) system using the 5250 communication protocol.

3. That providing users with the ability to interact with the IBM i server’s green-screen interface, run programs, execute commands, and access files and databases. 

4. IT get feels just like using a real IBM 5250 terminal.

5. Supports tasks like running RPGLE programs, CL commands, and database operations.

# RPGLE

## Definition

1. In this concept we are going to learn RPGLE program.

2. The abbrevation of RPGLE is Report Program Generator Language – Extended

3. It is high-level programming language used on IBM i (AS/400) systems for developing business applications.

4. It is an enhanced version of the original RPG language that supports modern programming features such as free-form coding, modularization, database access using SQL, and integration with other languages like Java or Python.

5. It can interact with IBM i databases directly.

6. Programs written in RPGLE are typically compiled and run on IBM i.

7. In this program there are lots of commands are used.
